This program is intended to alleviate some of the pains that one might encounter when
watching shows in more than one place. And so, instead of remembering to check a bunch
of websites each day, you can just write down all the shows in this program.

To get started press the "+" button in the top left of the main window. This button
will open another window, wherein information about the show can be entered.
Some of these are self-explanatory - but not all of them.

One of these outliers is the weight of a show. This value is used for
sorting the shows. The shows with the heighest weight, and therefore the
most important, are displayed at the top. Note that weights can be negative."""

Before really using this program, there are some things that you shold know.

First of all, by clicking on a title of a show, you can change its color.

Second of all, the episode and season counter can be adjusted simply by clicking
on the counter itself. It will go up and down depending on where you click it.

Third of all, in the top-left corner there is an arrow button. This button is one of those
"Show more/less" buttons. This button exists for the sake of performance.
When displaying hundreds of shows, the program can become slow (I mean, that is a lot of
stuff to display, right?). How many shows are being displayed in show-less-mode is
configurable in the settings.
