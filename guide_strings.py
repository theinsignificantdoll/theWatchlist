    """INTRODUCTION
This program is intended to alleviate some of the pains that one might encounter when
watching shows in more than one place. And so, instead of remembering to check a bunch
of websites each day, you can just write down all the shows in this program.

To get started press the "+" button in the top left of the main window. This button
will open another window, wherein information about the show can be entered.
Some of these are self-explanatory - but not all of them.

One of these outliers is the weight of a show. This value is used for
sorting the shows. The shows with the heighest weight, and therefore the
most important, are displayed at the top. Note that weights can be negative."""

Before really using this program, there are some things that you shold know.

First of all, by clicking on a title of a show, you can change its color.

Second of all, the episode and season counter can be adjusted simply by clicking
on the counter itself. It will go up and down depending on where you click it.

Third of all, in the top-left corner there is an arrow button. This button is one of those
"Show more/less" buttons. This button exists for the sake of performance.
When displaying hundreds of shows, the program can become slow (I mean, that is a lot of
stuff to display, right?). How many shows are being displayed in show-less-mode is
configurable in the settings.

The first two settings are simple. Font size is the size of the font. Note that this also
impacts the size of many windows. Font type is nearly as simple. However, fonts should be
monotype. This means that the characters are equally wide and helps with alignment.
You can freely experiment yourself, though.

The next one is a bit more complicated. "Text color" covers all the colors that shows can be
it also covers the default cover of text in other windows. This setting is a list of
hex color codes, seperated by "-". If you have a hard time finding hex color codes, you can
use a color picker. Just a remember to seperate all codes by "-"!

Next is the background color. To pick a new one, just press "Background Color".
You can pick the menu background color in much the same way, but what it does is a bit different.
It changes the background color of the right-click menu (Try right-clicking "LINK" or
one of the titles).
Menu font size is simply the size of the font in the right click menu.

Button color is the color of the text on buttons.
"""

settings_ii =\
    """SETTINGS II
Search results is how many results should be displayed when searching (magnifying glass in the top-left)

Title length is the maximum amount of characters to be displayed in a title. This is useful,
if you'd like to avoid one really long title pushing all the other things away!

Show Cut-off is the number of shows, which will be displayed when "Show Less" is updated (see Important)

Field background color is the background color of the fields, wherin the user can write. (Like the
ones in the settings window)

Shorten with ellipsis will, if activated, make it so that the last three characters in a title
that has been shortened is "...".

Release Grace Period is a bit advanced. Moreover, it isn't needed quite yet, therefore it will
be covered in another tab.

Default text color is the text color used within subwindows like this one (Or settings itself)
