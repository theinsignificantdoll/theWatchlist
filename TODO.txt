It can currently be slightly difficult to see which elements are on the same row.
  In order to fix this, some kind of visual aid should be added.

  I attempted to make the background color of a row change when the cursor hovers over,
  however i found this to be problematic for two reasons. First of all, the
  elements that make up a row are not contained within a single element. This makes it difficult,
  if not impossible, to change the entire background color of a row ugly spots inbetween elements.
  Moreover, I also noticed that the compute power needed to implement this highlight was quite significant.

I sometimes find it slightly difficult to distinguish between the titles of shows. Something should be done.
  idk what, though. I'm not a graphic designer.

Todo: i've added a method to the Show class, that is capable of checking whether or not a show was released
 within x hours. Next step is to add a setting, that allows the user to control the value of x.
 Moreover, shows should be somehow marked when they are within their grace_period. (And this should be updated
 periodically). Rather than displaying Show.release_info, whether or not a new episode is out should be displayed.
 DONE: REMOVE NEXT UPDATE

Todo: Add a guides menu.  - The program has recently gained more and more features which might be difficult for
 other users (if ever they come to exist) to understand. Therefore, a guide window should be added, so that new users
 will have somewhere to learn from.
