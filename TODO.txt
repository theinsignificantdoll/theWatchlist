It can currently be slightly difficult to see which elements are on the same row.
  In order to fix this, some kind of visual aid should be added.

  I attempted to make the background color of a row change when the cursor hovers over,
  however i found this to be problematic for two reasons. First of all, the
  elements that make up a row are not contained within a single element. This makes it difficult,
  if not impossible, to change the entire background color of a row ugly spots inbetween elements.
  Moreover, I also noticed that the compute power needed to implement this highlight was quite significant.

I sometimes find it slightly difficult to distinguish between the titles of shows. Something should be done.
  idk what, though. I'm not a graphic designer.
  As of now, this has been improved. The fonttype no longer needs to be monotype. This, i find, helps
  a lot with distinguishing between titles. This makes sense, since it also makes the shape of the titles more distinct
  DONE (for now anyway)
