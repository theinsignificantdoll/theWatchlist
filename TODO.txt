# TODOLIST

22. July 2023
It can currently be slightly difficult to see which elements are on the same row.
  In order to fix this, some kind of visual aid should be added.

  I attempted to make the background color of a row change when the cursor hovers over,
  however i found this to be problematic for two reasons. First of all, the
  elements that make up a row are not contained within a single element. This makes it difficult,
  if not impossible, to change the entire background color of a row ugly spots inbetween elements.
  Moreover, I also noticed that the compute power needed to implement this highlight was quite significant.

When the program updates the savefiles have to be updated manually. This should be fixed - mostly if anyone else ever starts using this program.
  The settings.csv file no longer requires manual updating. saved.csv still does.
  UPDATE: since there aren't any older versions being used, the ability for the program to read old saved.csv files need only go back to now.
  That also means, that this todo has been taken care of. Therefore, it should be deleted during the next update to the TODO file.

I sometimes find it slightly difficult to distinguish between the titles of shows. Something should be done.
  idk what, though. I'm not a graphic designer.

It'd be great if the user, which is to say me, didn't have to manually check for new episodes every day.
  It might be reasonable to assign each show a weekday - i.e. the day upon which a new episode is published.
  An alternative to that, might be a webscraper or API something something. Whatever the case may be, each service
  will require its own new-episode-checker.
