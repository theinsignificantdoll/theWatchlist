# TODOLIST

It can currently be slightly difficult to see which elements are on the same row.
  In order to fix this, some kind of visual aid should be added.

  I attempted to make the background color of a row change when the cursor hovers over,
  however i found this to be problematic for two reasons. First of all, the
  elements that make up a row are not contained within a single element. This makes it difficult,
  if not impossible, to change the entire background color of a row ugly spots inbetween elements.
  Moreover, I also noticed that the compute power needed to implement this highlight was quite significant.

Given the recent change in title visualisation some titles are now ugly, as they aren't being
properly shortened anymore. (When using non-monotype fonts and negative title lengths)
TODO: add a better way to shorten titles. Addendum: I'm not sure it's feasible, unfortunately. I might just remove
 this later.
