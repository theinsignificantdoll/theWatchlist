It can currently be slightly difficult to see which elements are on the same row.
  In order to fix this, some kind of visual aid should be added.

  I attempted to make the background color of a row change when the cursor hovers over,
  however i found this to be problematic for two reasons. First of all, the
  elements that make up a row are not contained within a single element. This makes it difficult,
  if not impossible, to change the entire background color of a row ugly spots inbetween elements.
  Moreover, I also noticed that the compute power needed to implement this highlight was quite significant.

I sometimes find it slightly difficult to distinguish between the titles of shows. Something should be done.
  idk what, though. I'm not a graphic designer.

Todo: Add a guides menu.  - The program has recently gained more and more features which might be difficult for
 other users (if ever they come to exist) to understand. Therefore, a guide window should be added, so that new users
 will have somewhere to learn from.

Todo: Did you know that PySimpleGUI has a Color Picker Button? It opens one of those fancy color picking windows.
 Yeah, i didn't. Colors in setttings should be picked using this button, it's way better.

Todo: Users are dumb. Rather than having the user themselves write the release_info string, there should be a window
 that merely generates it. Even the dumbest user must be capable of using that. Right? RIHGT? I say that as if
 it's been more than, like, one or two hours since release_info parsing was added. Heh.
