It can currently be slightly difficult to see which elements are on the same row.
  In order to fix this, some kind of visual aid should be added.

  I attempted to make the background color of a row change when the cursor hovers over,
  however i found this to be problematic for two reasons. First of all, the
  elements that make up a row are not contained within a single element. This makes it difficult,
  if not impossible, to change the entire background color of a row ugly spots inbetween elements.
  Moreover, I also noticed that the compute power needed to implement this highlight quite significant.

When the program updates the savefiles have to be updated manually. This should be fixed - mostly if anyone else ever starts using this program.

I sometimes find it slightly difficult to distinguish between the titles of shows. Something should be done.
  idk what, though. I'm not a graphic designer.

It'd be great if I, which is to say me, didn't have to manually check for new episodes every day.
  It might be reasonable to assign each show a weekday - i.e. the day upon which a new episode is published.
  An alternative to that, might be a webscraper or API something something. Whatever the case may be, each service
  will require its own new-episode-checker.
