It can currently be slightly difficult to see which elements are on the same row.
  In order to fix this, some kind of visual aid should be added.

  I attempted to make the background color of a row change when the cursor hovers over,
  however i found this to be problematic for two reasons. First of all, the
  elements that make up a row are not contained within a single element. This makes it difficult,
  if not impossible, to change the entire background color of a row ugly spots inbetween elements.
  Moreover, I also noticed that the compute power needed to implement this highlight was quite significant.

I sometimes find it slightly difficult to distinguish between the titles of shows. Something should be done.
  idk what, though. I'm not a graphic designer.

  Given the recent addition of release info to shows, it could become annoying for the user (me) to get rid of shows
  once they've been watched. Till now, this has been possible to do, by simply changing the color of the show and
  changing its weight. However, now, one must also press the "ongoing" checkbox within properties. Moreover, it would
  be theoretically optimal to also purge the release info of the show. But, doing all of that is a lot of work
  and I, the user, am very lazy.
  TODO: add a button that will allow the user to quickly purge release info, set ongoing to False and assign
   a new weight value to the show.
  DONE - REMOVE NEXT UPDATE TO FILE
